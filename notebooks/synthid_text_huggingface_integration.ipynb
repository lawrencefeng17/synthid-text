    "    [Gemma][gemma] or [GPT-2][gpt2]) and device (either CPU or GPU, depending\n",
    "    on your runtime), defining the watermarking configuration, and initializing\n",

    "1.  **_Applying a watermark_**: Loading your selected model using the\n",
    "    [Hugging Face Transformers][transformers] library, using that model to\n",
    "    generate some watermarked text, and comparing the perplexity of the\n",
    "    watermarked text to that of text generated by the base model.\n",
    "1.  **_Detecting a watermark_**: Training a detector to recognize text generated\n",
    "    with a specific watermarking configuration, and then using that detector to\n",
    "    predict whether a set of examples were generated with that configuration.\n",
